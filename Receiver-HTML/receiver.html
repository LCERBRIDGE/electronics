          <P>The cryostat (cylinder with a white cover) contains the high
            frequency feed (HFF) and low noise
            amplifiers which
            increase the radio frequency (RF) signals of the vertical and
            horizontal radio waves. The HFF amplifiers work from 2 to 14 GHz.
            A plate of absorbing material can be rotated in front of the feed
            to reduce the incoming radiation by 90%. It also adds a known
            signal, which is 90% of the thermal (blackbody) radiation of the
            plate, to
            calibrate the signal.

            The rest of the RF electronics is in the receiver box mounted
            on the surface of the antenna.  There is another almost identical
            set of electronics for a low frequency feed (LFF).

          <H3 align="center">Down Converters</H3>
          <P>
            There are four downconverters, each of which converts the two
            polarizations to frequencies at which the signals can be digitized
            and detected. Each downconverter can be tuned for a different RF
            band which is 2000 MHz wide.
          </P>
          <P>
            Four plates with electronics like the one shown here are in the
            receiver box along with the RF electronics.
          </P>
          <P>
            The diagram below is for the electronics of one of the two polarizations
            of one down-converter.  The image shows both channels.

          <H3 align="center">Outputs</H3>
          <P>
            Each of the two channels of a downconverter has two outputs, one
            for -1000 to 0 MHz (called the lower sideband -- LSB) and the other
            for 0 to 1000 MHz (called the upper sideband -- USB) of the 2000 MHz
            RF band which is down-converted.
            Each of these sidebands has four outputs:<BR/>
            <B>signal voltage</B> of the 1000 MHz wide band, or some part of
            that passed by an  optional filter,<BR/>
            <B>signal voltage</B> reduced by 50%,<BR/>
            <B>rectified voltage</B>, which is the square of the voltage
            (negative voltages removed) and averaged,<BR/>
            <B>pulses</B> from a voltage to frequency (VFC) converter.
